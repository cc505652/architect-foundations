# Architect Foundations

This repository documents my structured journey toward a **Cloud / Security Architect** role.

## Scope
- Linux system administration & access control
- Networking fundamentals with security context
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS)
- Architecture diagrams & design tradeoffs

## Methodology
- Learn core concepts
- Apply hands-on
- Document decisions and tradeoffs
- Back learning with projects (certs come last)

This is a **design-first repo**, not a collection of commands.
