## 🧠 Learning Methodology

For every seeded concept:
1. Learn core ideas
2. Apply hands-on
3. Document real behavior
4. Reflect on security implications and architectural tradeoffs

This transforms raw knowledge into **design-grade maturity**.

## 📌 How to Explore

1. Read daily logs (`daily-logs/`) for mindset & risk reasoning.
2. Review topic modules (`linux/`, `networking/`) for detailed outputs.
3. Diagrams will support project framing once cloud projects begin.
