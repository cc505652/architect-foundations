# Daily Log — Dec 26

## Focus

VPC fundamentals and public vs private subnet design.

## Key Learnings

- VPC is a security boundary
- Subnets control exposure
- Routing defines reachability

## What Could Go Wrong?

- Placing sensitive resources in public subnets
- Incorrect route tables exposing instances
- Over-reliance on security groups alone

## How to Defend

- Strict subnet separation
- Intentional routing
- Defense in depth (subnets + SGs)

## Tradeoffs

- Simplicity vs security
- Cost vs isolation
