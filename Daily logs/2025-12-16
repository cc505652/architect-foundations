# Daily Log — Dec 16, 2025

## Focus
Linux filesystem fundamentals, package management, OSI model, and basic networking commands.

---

## Key Learnings

**Linux**
- The Linux filesystem hierarchy avoids mixing config, logs, and data.
- Package management (`apt`) centralizes install/upgrade.
- Understanding directories helps anticipate where security policies should apply.

**Networking**
- OSI model provides mental mapping from application protocols to physical connectivity.
- Commands like `ip a`, `ping`, and `traceroute` reveal host and path state.

---

## Risks & Security Implications

- Misconfiguring files in `/etc` can break services or open attack surface.
- Unrestricted ports/services can be probed and exploited.
- Lack of process awareness increases incident response time.

---

## Defenses Applied

- Practiced accessing key directories and identifying appropriate permission domains.
- Observed path behavior and routing fundamentals.

---

## Tradeoffs

- Restrictive permissions increase security but may impede legitimate administration if too tight.
- Monitoring consumes resources but improves visibility.
