# Daily Log — Dec 16, 2025

## Focus
Linux filesystem, package management, OSI model & networking fundamentals.

---

## Key Learnings

**Linux**
- The Linux filesystem (`/`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/home`) separates configuration, logs, and user data.  
- Package management (`apt`) centralizes software installation and upgrades.

**Networking**
- OSI model maps real-world protocols to abstraction layers for diagnostics.  
- Tools (`ip a`, `ping`, `traceroute`) reveal host state and path hops.

---

## Risks & Security Implications

- Misconfigured `/etc` scripts can break system services.
- Unpatched packages expose CVEs.
- Unfiltered network paths can be exploited at multiple OSI layers.

---

## Defenses Applied

- Practiced directory exploration with awareness of sensitive locations.
- Reviewed potential attack surfaces in network path discovery.

---

## Tradeoffs

- Deep understanding vs. speed of learning — chose depth.
- Observability (`logs`) vs. performance overhead.
