## Focus

Linux hardening consolidation and security posture review.

### What I built

- A hardened Linux host with minimal exposure
- Clear mapping between threats and defenses

## Key Learnings

- Hardening is layered, not one setting
- Security posture must be reviewed, not assumed
- Documentation turns actions into design

## What Could Go Wrong?

- Drift from secure configuration
- Unmonitored access changes
- False sense of security
- Zero-day exploits
- Insider misuse
- Misconfiguration during future changes

## How to Defend

- Periodic reviews
- Change tracking
- Minimal exposure
- Intrusion detection
- Centralized logging
- Regular audits

## Tradeoffs

- Security rigor vs admin convenience
- Security vs convenience
- Minimal exposure vs operational flexibility
