# Daily Log – Dec 20

### Focus

SSH hardening, firewall rules, and access control.

## Key Learnings

- SSH is a high-risk access vector
- Firewalls must be explicit and intentional
- Default deny is safer than default allow

## What Could Go Wrong?

- SSH misconfiguration locking out admins
- Firewall blocking critical services
- Overconfidence in perimeter defenses

## How to Defend

- Test access after every change
- Layer security (keys + firewall)
- Monitor exposed ports regularly

## Tradeoffs

- Security vs convenience
- Restriction vs operational flexibility
