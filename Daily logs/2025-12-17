## Focus
Linux access control + TCP vs UDP tradeoffs

## Key Learnings

- Linux user groups enable scalable access policies
- TCP is reliable, UDP is fast — but the security tradeoffs matter
- Permissions must be reviewed as part of system hardening

## What Could Go Wrong?

- Overly permissive ACLs
- Misassigned groups
- Unfiltered TCP services

## How to Defend

- Least privilege
- Group-centric access
- Firewall + service hardening

## Tradeoffs

- Granular permissions vs admin overhead
- TCP reliability vs UDP performance
