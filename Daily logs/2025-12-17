## Focus
Linux users, groups, permission models; deep comparison of TCP and UDP.

---

## Key Learnings

**Linux Access Control**
- Users and groups enable scalable access partitioning.
- Permissions regulate owner/group/other read/write/execute vectors.
- Role separation limits blast radius of incidents.

**TCP vs UDP**
- TCP is connection-oriented, reliable, and stateful — suited for control protocols like SSH and HTTP.
- UDP is connectionless, faster — appropriate for DNS and streaming, but with different security risks.

---

## Risks & Security Implications

- Overly permissive ACLs foster lateral movement and data leakage.
- Misassigned groups can inadvertently grant access to sensitive resources.
- Unprotected TCP services invite handshake & session manipulation.

---

## Defenses Applied

- Created role-based groups and properly limited directory access.
- Evaluated protocol choice through a security lens, not just performance.

---

## Tradeoffs

- Granular groups improve security but increase management cost.
- Reliable transport (TCP) incurs overhead but reduces retransmission errors.
