## Focus
Linux users/groups + permissions; TCP vs UDP tradeoffs.

---

## Key Learnings

**Linux Access Control**
- Users and groups enable granular access policies.
- Permissions determine read/write/execute at owner/group/other levels.
- Access control prevents unauthorized actions.

**Networking Protocols**
- TCP provides connection reliability and sequencing.
- UDP offers simpler, faster datagrams without guarantees.
- The choice affects performance and attack surface.

---

## Risks & Security Implications

- Overly permissive ACLs allow lateral movement and data theft.
- Unrestricted TCP services increase exposure to session attacks.

---

## Defenses Applied

- Created dedicated users and groups for roles.
- Set appropriate ownership and permissions for directories.
- Compared TCP/UDP tradeoffs for service exposure.

---

## Tradeoffs

- Granular permissions vs. admin overhead.
- Reliability vs. performance.
