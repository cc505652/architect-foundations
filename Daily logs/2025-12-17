### What I learned

- Role-based access using users and groups
- Permission models and real risks
- Practical TCP vs UDP tradeoffs

### What could go wrong?

- Excessive permissions expose sensitive data
- Wrong protocol choice affects reliability and security

### How I would defend it

- Least privilege
- Clear role separation
- Firewall rules aligned to protocol behavior

### Tradeoffs

- Security vs operational convenience
- Performance vs reliability
