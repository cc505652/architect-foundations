# Daily Log – Dec 18

## Focus

Linux processes & logs, subnetting and CIDR.

## Key Learnings

- Processes reveal system behavior
- Logs provide incident timelines
- Subnets control exposure and blast radius

## What Could Go Wrong?

- Malicious processes running unnoticed
- Brute-force attacks hidden in auth logs
- Flat networks enabling lateral movement

## How to Defend

- Monitor processes
- Centralize logs
- Segment networks with subnets

## Tradeoffs

- Logging vs storage cost
- Segmentation vs operational complexity
