## Focus

S3 security and IAM role-based access from EC2.

## Key Learnings

- Data security is permission-driven
- IAM roles eliminate static credentials
- S3 misconfigurations are a major breach vector

## What Could Go Wrong?

- Public bucket exposure
- Over-permissive IAM policies
- Role misuse by compromised instances

## How to Defend

- Block public access
- Least privilege roles
- Monitor access patterns

## Tradeoffs

- Ease of access vs strict permissions
- Simplicity vs granular policies
