## Focus

EC2 deployment and Security Group design.

## Key Learnings

## What Could Go Wrong?

- SSH exposed to the internet
- Key leakage
- Overly permissive security groups

## How to Defend

- IP-restricted rules
- Key rotation
- Least privilege networking

## Tradeoffs

- Accessibility vs security
- Simplicity vs control
