## Focus

systemd services, service failure simulation, gateways and NAT.

## Key Learnings

- Services define system availability
- systemd manages lifecycle and recovery
- Gateways control external reachability
- NAT enables private networks to access the internet

## What Could Go Wrong?

- Critical services stopped accidentally
- No gateway → no connectivity
- Misconfigured NAT → broken outbound traffic

## How to Defend

- Monitor service status
- Enable critical services at boot
- Design proper gateway/NAT placement

## Tradeoffs

- Automation vs manual control
- Isolation vs connectivity
