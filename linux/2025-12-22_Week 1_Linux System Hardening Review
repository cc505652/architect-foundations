# Week 1 – Linux System Hardening Review

## System Overview

- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Access: SSH (key-based)
- Firewall: Enabled (default deny)

---

## Access Control

- Root login disabled
- Password authentication disabled
- Role-based users and groups applied

### Why this matters

Prevents brute-force attacks and limits privilege escalation.

---

## Service Management

- SSH enabled and monitored
- Unnecessary services disabled

### Why this matters

Reduces attack surface and improves availability control.

---

## Network Exposure

- Firewall allows only required inbound traffic
- No unnecessary open ports

### Why this matters

Minimizes external attack vectors.

---

## Logging & Visibility

- Authentication logs monitored
- System logs available for incident response

### Why this matters

Enables detection and forensic analysis.

---

## Residual Risks

- Kernel vulnerabilities
- SSH key compromise
- Misconfiguration over time

---

## Overall Security Posture

This system is reasonably hardened for a small production workload, with layered defenses and minimal exposure.

## Threat Model (Basic)

### Threats Considered

- SSH brute force
- Unauthorized access
- Service misuse
- Network scanning

### Mitigations Applied

- SSH hardening
- Firewall default deny
- Role separation
- Logging and monitoring

### Tradeoffs

- Increased setup complexity
- Reduced convenience for administrators

## Final Hardening Summary

- SSH hardened (key-only, no root, limited retries)
- Firewall enforcing least privilege
- Unused services disabled
- Users and privileges reviewed
- Logs accessible and monitored

---

## Key Takeaway

Security is not one control — it is the absence of unnecessary ones.
