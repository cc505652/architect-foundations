# Dec 18 – Linux Processes & Logs

## Objective

Understand how Linux manages running programs and how logs provide visibility into system behavior and security events.

---

## Process Management

## What is a process?

A process is a running instance of a program managed by the kernel.

## Why process visibility matters

- Malware runs as processes
- Runaway processes cause outages
- Incident response starts by identifying abnormal processes

## Signals

- SIGTERM: graceful shutdown
- SIGKILL: force stop (last resort)

## Architect Insight

Lack of process visibility delays detection and recovery.

### ps

Displays currently running processes.

```bash
ps aux

```

**Why:**

Provides a snapshot of all active processes.

**Risk if misused:**

Killing critical processes can crash services.

### top

Real-time process monitoring.

```bash
top
```

**Why:** Identifies CPU and memory-heavy processes.

**Risk if misused:** Misinterpreting spikes without context.

---

### htop

Enhanced interactive process viewer.

```bash
htop
```

**Why:** Easier visualization for debugging performance issues.

---

### kill

Terminates a process by PID.

```bash
kill <PID>
```

Force kill:

```bash
kill -9 <PID>
```

**Why:** Stops misbehaving or compromised processes.

**Risk if misused:** Data loss or service outage.

---

## System Logs

### Viewing log directories

```bash
ls /var/log
```

---

### auth.log

Authentication-related logs.

```bash
sudocat /var/log/auth.log
```

**Why:** Detects failed logins, sudo usage, SSH access.

---

### syslog

General system events.

```bash
sudocat /var/log/syslog
```

**Why:** Helps trace crashes and system issues.

---

### journalctl

Systemd journal viewer.

```bash
journalctl
journalctl -xe
```

**Why:** Centralized log access for modern Linux systems.

---

## Log Monitoring

### tail

View latest log entries.

```bash
sudotail -n 20 /var/log/auth.log

```

**Why:** Used during live incident investigation.

---

### Important Logs

- /var/log/syslog: system events
- /var/log/auth.log: authentication activity

## Why logs matter

Logs provide a timeline of events for debugging and incident response.

## Security Insight

Without logs, breaches can go undetected for months.

## Key Takeaways

- Processes show what the system is doing *now*.
- Logs show what happened *over time*.
- Incident response always starts with logs.
