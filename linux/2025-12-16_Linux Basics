# Dec 16 – Linux Basics

## Linux Filesystem Overview

### /

Root of the filesystem. Everything starts here.

### /home

User directories live here. Each user gets their own space.

### /etc

System-wide configuration files. Critical for system behavior.

### /var

Variable data like logs, caches, spools.

### /var/log

System and application logs. Key for debugging and security.

### /whoami

Displays the currently logged-in user.

## Commands Used

- ls - Lists files and directories in the current directory
- cd -  Changes the current working directory
- pwd - Prints the full path of the current working directory

## Key Takeaway

Linux is structured logically. Configuration, logs, and user data are separated for stability and security.

## Package Management

- apt update: updates package index
- apt upgrade: upgrades installed packages
- apt install: installs software

Installed tools:

- tree - Displays directory structure in a tree format
- htop - Interactive process viewer showing CPU, memory, and running processes
- net-tools - Collection of legacy networking tools (e.g., ifconfig, netstat)

## File Operations Practiced

- touch - Creates an empty file
    
    # touch file1.txt file2.txt 
    
- echo - Writes text into a file (overwrites existing content)
    
    # echo "Hello Linux" > file1.txt
    
- cat - Displays the contents of a file
    
    # cat file1.txt
    
- cp - Copies a file from source to destination
    
    # cp file1.txt copy_file1.txt
    
- mv - Moves or renames a file or directory
    
    # mv file2.txt renamed_file2.txt
    
- rm - Deletes a file
    
    # rm copy_file1.txt
    

## Key Takeaway

Linux package management is centralized and reliable. File operations are simple but powerful.

### Why this matters
- Misconfigured FS can leak secrets
- Poor permissions expose services
