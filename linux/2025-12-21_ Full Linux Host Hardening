## Objective

Consolidate Linux security fundamentals into a single hardened host design with clear threat reasoning.

---

## 1. User & Access Review

### List users

```bash
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd
```

**Why:** Identify all system and human users.

**Risk if ignored:** Orphaned users become backdoors.

### Review sudo access

```bash
sudo getent groupsudo

```

**Why:** Only trusted users should have administrative rights.

---

## 2. SSH Security Validation

### Confirm SSH configuration

```bash
sudo grep -E"PermitRootLogin|PasswordAuthentication|MaxAuthTries" /etc/ssh/sshd_config

```

Expected:

- `PermitRootLogin no`
- `PasswordAuthentication no`
- `MaxAuthTries 3`

---

### Check SSH exposure

```bash
ss -tulnp | grep ssh

```

**Why:** Verify SSH is the only exposed service.

---

## 3. Firewall Audit

### View active rules

```bash
sudo ufw status verbose

```

Expected:

- Default deny incoming
- SSH allowed
- Everything else blocked

---

## 4. Service Minimization

### List running services

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running

```

### Disable unnecessary services (example)

```bash
sudo systemctldisable bluetooth
sudo systemctl stop bluetooth

```

**Why:** Every running service increases attack surface.

**Risk if misused:** Disabling critical services causes outages.

---

## 5. Process Visibility

### Identify top resource consumers

```bash
htop

```

**Why:** Malware often reveals itself through abnormal resource usage.

---

## 6. Log Visibility Check

### Authentication events

```bash
sudotail -n 50 /var/log/auth.log

```

### System events

```bash
sudo journalctl -p warning

```

**Why:** Logs are your forensic timeline.

---

## 7. Final Exposure Review

### All listening ports

```bash
ss -tulnp

```

Expected result:

- SSH only
- No unexpected listeners

---

# Week 1 – Linux System Hardening Review

## System Overview

- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Access: SSH (key-based)
- Firewall: Enabled (default deny)

---

## Access Control

- Root login disabled
- Password authentication disabled
- Role-based users and groups applied

### Why this matters

Prevents brute-force attacks and limits privilege escalation.

---

## Service Management

- SSH enabled and monitored
- Unnecessary services disabled

### Why this matters

Reduces attack surface and improves availability control.

---

## Network Exposure

- Firewall allows only required inbound traffic
- No unnecessary open ports

### Why this matters

Minimizes external attack vectors.

---

## Logging & Visibility

- Authentication logs monitored
- System logs available for incident response

### Why this matters

Enables detection and forensic analysis.

---

## Residual Risks

- Kernel vulnerabilities
- SSH key compromise
- Misconfiguration over time

---

## Overall Security Posture

This system is reasonably hardened for a small production workload, with layered defenses and minimal exposure.

## Threat Model (Basic)

### Threats Considered

- SSH brute force
- Unauthorized access
- Service misuse
- Network scanning

### Mitigations Applied

- SSH hardening
- Firewall default deny
- Role separation
- Logging and monitoring

### Tradeoffs

- Increased setup complexity
- Reduced convenience for administrators

## Final Hardening Summary

- SSH hardened (key-only, no root, limited retries)
- Firewall enforcing least privilege
- Unused services disabled
- Users and privileges reviewed
- Logs accessible and monitored

---

## Key Takeaway

Security is not one control — it is the absence of unnecessary ones.
