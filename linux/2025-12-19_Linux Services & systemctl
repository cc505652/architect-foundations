## Objective

Understand how Linux manages long-running services and why service control is critical for availability and security.

---

## What is a Service?

A service is a background process designed to run continuously (e.g., SSH, web servers, databases).

Linux uses **systemd** to manage services.

---

## Service Management

### systemctl status

Checks the current state of a service.

```bash
systemctl status ssh
```

**Why:** Confirms whether a service is running, stopped, or failed.

**Risk if ignored:** Failed services can silently break systems.

---

### systemctl start

Starts a service.

```bash
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

**Why:** Manually bring services online.

---

### systemctl stop

Stops a service.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop ssh
```

**Why:** Used during maintenance or incident response.

**Risk:** Stopping critical services causes downtime.

---

### systemctl restart

Restarts a service.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

**Why:** Applies config changes safely.

---

### systemctl enable

Ensures service starts at boot.

```bash
sudo systemctlenable ssh
```

**Why:** Guarantees persistence after reboot.

**Risk:** Enabling unnecessary services increases attack surface.

---

### systemctl disable

Prevents service from starting at boot.

```bash
sudo systemctldisable ssh
```

**Why:** Reduces exposure when service isn’t required.

---

## Listing Services

### systemctl list-units

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service
```

**Why:** Shows all active services.

---

### systemctl list-unit-files

```bash
systemctl list-unit-files --type=service
```

**Why:** Shows which services are enabled or disabled at boot.

---

## Security Insight

Every enabled service is a potential entry point.

Architects minimize **what runs**, not just secure what runs.

## Failure Simulation

Stopped cron service intentionally.

### Observations

- Service status changed immediately
- Logs recorded stop/start events

### Why this matters

In incidents, knowing what service failed and why saves time.

### Recovery

Restarted service via systemctl.
