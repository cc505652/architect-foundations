Dec 25 – Amazon S3 Basics & Secure Permissions

## Objective

Understand how object storage works in AWS and how access to data is controlled using identity and policies.

---

## What S3 Is

Amazon S3 is an object storage service designed for durability, scalability, and global access.

It does NOT behave like a traditional filesystem.

---

## Create an S3 Bucket

### Steps

- Go to S3 → Create bucket
- Bucket name: dec-secure-bucket-<unique-id>
- Region: same as EC2
- Block ALL public access: ENABLED
- Bucket versioning: Disabled (for now)

**Why:**

- Buckets are globally unique
- Public access is the #1 cause of S3 data leaks

---

## Upload a Test Object

Upload a file:

- `test.txt`
- Content: `S3 access test`

---

## Access Test (Expected to FAIL)

Try accessing the object using its URL.

**Expected result:** Access denied

**Why:**

S3 is private by default when public access is blocked.

---

## S3 Permission Layers

### 1. Bucket Policy

Resource-based policy applied to the bucket.

### 2. IAM Policy

Identity-based policy applied to users or roles.

### 3. ACLs (Legacy)

Fine-grained, mostly avoided today.

---

## Key Security Takeaways

- Never make buckets public unless explicitly required
- Prefer IAM roles over public or user-based access
- S3 breaches are usually configuration errors, not exploits
