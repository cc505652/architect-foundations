# Dec 26 – VPC Fundamentals

## What a VPC Is

A Virtual Private Cloud is a logically isolated network inside AWS where I control IP addressing, routing, and access.

It is the cloud equivalent of an on-prem data center network.

## Why VPC Exists

- Network isolation
- Custom IP addressing
- Security boundaries

## What Lives Inside a VPC

- Subnets
- Route tables
- Internet Gateway
- NAT Gateway
- Security Groups
- Network ACLs

## CIDR Planning

VPC CIDR:
10.0.0.0/16

Why:

- Large private address space
- Room for growth
- Non-overlapping with typical home networks

## Architect Insight

A VPC is the foundation of cloud security and traffic control.
