# Dec 23 – AWS IAM (Identity & Access Management)

## What is IAM?

IAM controls who can access AWS resources and what actions they can perform.

## Core Concepts

- User: human identity
- Group: collection of users
- Role: assumed identity with permissions
- Policy: permission document

## Why IAM is Critical

Most cloud breaches happen due to IAM misconfigurations, not hacking.

## IAM User Setup

Created a non-root IAM user with read-only access.

### Security Rationale

- Reduces blast radius
- Prevents accidental destructive actions

## Identity in AWS

### Root Account

- Full control
- Should never be used daily
- Protected with MFA

### IAM Users

- Represent humans or services
- Permissions are explicit

## Users vs Roles

Users:

- Long-term credentials
- For humans

Roles:

- Temporary credentials
- For services and cross-account access

## Why Roles Matter

Roles avoid hardcoding credentials and reduce credential leakage risk.

## Why This Matters

Most cloud breaches are caused by identity misuse, not hacking.

## Architect Insight

In production, services should use IAM roles, not IAM users.

## Architect Questions

1. What happens if root credentials are compromised?
2. Why is least privilege harder in cloud than on Linux?
3. Why is IAM the first security boundary in AWS?
