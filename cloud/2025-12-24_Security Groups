## Security Group vs ufw

| Aspect | Security Group | ufw |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Location | AWS edge | OS level |
| Type | Stateful | Stateful |
| Default | Deny inbound | Deny inbound |
| Scope | Instance | Host |

## Architect Insight

Security Groups replace traditional host firewalls at scale.

Cloud firewalls protect before traffic reaches the OS.
OS firewalls protect after traffic reaches the host.
