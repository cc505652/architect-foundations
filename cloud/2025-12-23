# Dec 23 – AWS Foundations (Security First)

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is on-demand access to compute, storage, and networking without owning physical infrastructure.

## What AWS Is

AWS is a collection of managed infrastructure services that abstract hardware while exposing control through APIs.

## Why Cloud Exists

- Elastic scaling
- Pay-as-you-go
- Global availability
- Faster deployment

## Shared Responsibility Model

- AWS secures the cloud
- Customer secures what’s in the cloud

## Cloud vs On-Prem

On-prem requires upfront cost and manual scaling.
Cloud trades control for speed and flexibility.

## AWS Global Infrastructure

- Region: geographic area (e.g., ap-south-1)
- Availability Zone (AZ): isolated data centers within a region
- Edge Locations: content delivery (CloudFront)

## Regions

Geographically separate locations.
Used for compliance, latency, and isolation.

## Availability Zones (AZs)

Multiple isolated data centers within a region.
Used for high availability.

## Edge Locations

Used for content delivery (CDN).
Not for running servers.

## Why this matters

Isolation between AZs enables high availability.

### Architect thinking :

- Why wouldn’t you deploy everything in one AZ?
- Why might a company restrict regions?
