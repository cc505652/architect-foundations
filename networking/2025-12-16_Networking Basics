## OSI Model (Practical View)

- Layer 7 (Application): HTTP, HTTPS, SSH
- Layer 4 (Transport): TCP, UDP
- Layer 3 (Network): IP addressing and routing
- Layer 2 (Data Link): MAC addresses
- Layer 1 (Physical): Hardware and signals

## Commands Used

- ip a - Displays network interfaces and IP addresses
- ip route - Shows the routing table and default gateway
- ping - Tests network connectivity by sending ICMP echo requests
- traceroute - Displays the path packets take to reach a destination

## Key Takeaway

Data flows top-down (application to wire) and bottom-up on receive. Security can be applied at multiple layers.
