# Dec 18 – Subnetting & CIDR (Architect Level)

## Objective

Understand how IP address space is divided and why subnetting is critical for security, scalability, and cost control.

---

## What is CIDR?

CIDR defines how many bits are used for the network vs hosts.

## CIDR Basics

### CIDR Notation

- /24 → 256 IPs
- /25 → 128 IPs
- /26 → 64 IPs
- /27 → 32 IPs
- /28 → 16 IPs

**Why:** Efficient IP usage and isolation.

## Subnetting Example

### Scenario

A company needs:

- Public subnet (web)
- Private subnet (app)
- Restricted subnet (db)

Base network:

```
10.0.0.0/24
Subnet breakdown:

Public: 10.0.0.0/26

App: 10.0.0.64/26

DB: 10.0.0.128/26

Why Subnetting Matters
Limits blast radius

Enables firewall zoning

Improves routing clarity

Supports least privilege networking

Common Mistakes
Flat networks (/24 everywhere)

Overlapping CIDRs

No separation between public and private assets

Key Takeaways
Subnetting is not math — it’s risk management.
```

## Why subnetting matters in cloud

- Public vs private isolation
- Blast radius control
- Cost & routing efficiency
