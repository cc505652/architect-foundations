## Objective

Understand how private networks access the internet and why gateways are critical control points.

---

## What is a Gateway?

A gateway is the device that routes traffic from a local network to external networks.

Usually:

- Router
- Firewall
- Cloud NAT device

## Default Gateway

All non-local traffic is sent to the default gateway.

Run:

```bash
ip route
```

You’ll see something like:

```
default via172.x.x.1 dev eth0
```

## Why gateways matter

Without a gateway, systems cannot reach external networks.

---

## Network Address Translation (NAT)

### Why NAT Exists

- Conserves IPv4 addresses
- Hides internal IP structure
- Acts as a basic security boundary

---

## NAT Flow (Conceptual)

Client (Private IP) → Gateway (NAT) → Internet

Internet → Gateway → Client

Internal IPs are **not visible** externally.

---

## Types of NAT

### SNAT (Source NAT)

- Internal → External traffic
- Changes source IP

### DNAT (Destination NAT)

- External → Internal traffic
- Used for port forwarding

---

## Security Implications

- NAT hides internal topology
- NAT alone is NOT a firewall
- Firewalls must still control traffic

---

## Architect View

- Gateways are choke points
- Logging at gateways is critical
- In cloud, NAT = managed service

In cloud:

- Internet Gateway enables external access
- NAT Gateway enables private subnet outbound access

---

## Key Takeaway

If you control the gateway, you control the network’s exposure.
