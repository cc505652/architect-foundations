## Objective

Understand how different firewall models track traffic and how this maps to real architectures.

---

## Stateful Firewalls

### Characteristics

- Track connection state
- Automatically allow return traffic
- Simpler rule sets

### Example

Linux ufw, AWS Security Groups

**Architect Impact:**

- Easier to manage
- Safer defaults
- Preferred for most application layers

---

## Stateless Firewalls

### Characteristics

- No connection tracking
- Explicit inbound and outbound rules
- More granular, more complex

### Example

Router ACLs, AWS Network ACLs

**Architect Impact:**

- Used at network boundaries
- High performance
- Easy to misconfigure

---

## Comparison

| Aspect | Stateful | Stateless |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tracks sessions | Yes | No |
| Rule complexity | Lower | Higher |
| Typical use | Hosts, apps | Network edge |
| Risk | Hidden trust | Human error |

---

## Architect Mapping

- Linux `ufw` → AWS Security Groups
- Router ACLs → AWS NACLs

---

## Key Takeaway

Use stateful controls close to applications, stateless controls at the network edge.
