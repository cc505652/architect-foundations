## Objective

Map realistic attack paths to specific defenses on a Linux server.

---

## Threat Model

### 1. Brute-force SSH Attack

**Defense:**

- PasswordAuthentication disabled
- MaxAuthTries limited
- Firewall restricts exposure

---

### 2. Exploitation of Exposed Services

**Defense:**

- Only SSH exposed
- Unused services disabled

---

### 3. Privilege Escalation

**Defense:**

- Limited sudo users
- Role-based access
- File permission controls

---

### 4. Malware Persistence

**Defense:**

- Service audit
- Process monitoring
- Log analysis

---

## Architect Insight

Security controls must be layered:

- Identity (users)
- Network (firewall)
- Host (services, processes)
- Visibility (logs)

---

## Key Takeaway

Threats are predictable. Defenses must be intentional.
