| Aspect | TCP | UDP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reliability | Guaranteed | Best effort |
| Speed | Slower | Faster |
| Order | Preserved | Not guaranteed |
| Use cases | Web, SSH, Email | DNS, VoIP, Streaming |
| Security risk | Session hijacking | Spoofing |

Displays active sockets.

```bash
ss -tulnp
```

### netstat

Legacy networking statistics tool.

```bash
netstat -tulnp

```

**Why:** Shows which services rely on TCP vs UDP in real systems.

## Architectural Decisions

### Why SSH uses TCP

- Needs reliability
- Command order matters
- Session integrity required

### Why DNS uses UDP

- Speed is critical
- Small payloads
- Retries handled at application level

---

## Security Implications

- TCP attacks: session hijacking, SYN floods
- UDP attacks: spoofing, amplification attacks
- Firewalls must treat them differently

---

## Key Takeaways

- Protocol choice affects performance, reliability, and security.
- Architects choose protocols based on business and risk tradeoffs.
